# CoachResearchAgent

**Recruiting Agent** is a streamlined tool that makes it easy for athletes to discover and contact college coaches.

You enter a **school name** and **select your sport** — the agent automatically pulls the **top 10 coaching staff members**, including:

- **Names & roles**
- **Email addresses**
- **Twitter accounts**

From there, you can:

- **Save coaches** to your personal list by school
- **Organize contacts** as you explore programs
- **Select multiple coaches** and send outreach in batches
    
    *(email or Twitter — fast, consistent, scalable)*
    

The goal:

make the recruiting process **simple**, **searchable**, and **action-ready** — no manual detective work, no scattered notes.

### **Why it exists**

Finding coaches takes time. Tracking them takes effort.

Outreach usually happens too late — or not at all.

Recruiting Agent removes friction so you can:

- **Discover programs quickly**
- **Build a contact base you control**
- **Stay consistent with outreach**
