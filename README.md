### **SKOUT | Start the Recruitment Process FAST**

**Find Coaches. Save Contacts. Reach Out Fast.**

**SKOUT** (stylized as **SKT**) is a streamlined AI platform that removes the friction from college recruiting. For less than the cost of lunch, **SKOUT** replaces manual detective work with high-speed automation, giving athletes the tools to discover programs and build a contact base they control.

The platform operates through two core modules:

### **FND | Discovery Module**

Stop wasting hours on search engines. **FND** uses AI to instantly map out your target programs.

- Enter a school and sport to pull the top 10 coaching staff members.
- Get instant access to **Names, Roles, Email Addresses,** and **Twitter handles**.
- Build your "Board"—save and organize programs into a centralized, action-ready list.

### **AGT | Outreach Module**

Consistency is what gets you recruited. **AGT** automates the heavy lifting of communication.

- Select multiple coaches from your **FND** list and engage.
- Send batch outreach via email or Twitter with one click.
- Maintain a fast, professional, and scalable presence in coaches' inboxes.
